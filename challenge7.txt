Explain the difference between calling a function from within 
a script block and calling a function from a button's onclick 
attribute. Write a short answer.
 calling a function from within a script block is different because it embed's the other function within the script block so it activates everything within that function it is embeded too whilst calling a function from a functions onclick attribute is a form of calling it from outside of a function and having it work as a solo operator.
